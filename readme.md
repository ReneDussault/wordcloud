# Personality Trait WordCloud
### Overview
This project creates a visual depiction of my personality traits as seen by my girlfriend, friends, and colleagues.  
The traits are collected and transformed into a word cloud, which visually emphasizes the most frequently mentioned characteristics.  
The larger and more prominent the word, the more frequently it was associated with me.

Some of the traits were shortened into a "catch-all" word to facilitate the creation of the wordcloud.  
Refer to the code (cloud.ipynb) to see the original lists of qualities / characteristics / traits.

ex.:  
"loves to share knowledge" -> mentor (educator could also work)  
"love for learning" -> learner (as in life long learner)


### Interpret the word cloud visualization:
Larger words represent traits mentioned more frequently.  
The positioning of words has no specific meaning; it is purely aesthetic.
